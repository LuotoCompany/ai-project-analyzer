# Project Overview

This software project implements a content management and social interaction platform where users can create, modify, and interact with articles, tags, comments, and follow relationships. The system exposes RESTful endpoints for common operations such as article management, user authentication, tag retrieval, and social interactions, using a modular architecture that supports separation of concerns across different layers.

---

# Purpose and Main Functionality

The primary goal of the project is to provide a robust backend for a real-world blogging or social application. Key functionalities include:  
- **User Management:** Registration, authentication (with JWT-based security), profile updates, and managing follow/unfollow relationships.  
- **Article Management:** Creating, editing, deleting, and retrieving articles, along with support for favoriting and filtering articles using dynamic querying.  
- **Tag Management:** Assigning, processing, and retrieving tags to categorize articles.  
- **Comment Management:** Allowing users to write, retrieve, and delete comments on articles.  
- **Social Interactions:** Enabling social features such as following other users and favoriting articles.
  
---

# Architecture and Key Components

The project is structured into multiple modules, each with a clear role:

- ## API Module
  - **Controllers:**  
    - Exposes RESTful endpoints (e.g., ArticleController, TagController, UserController) that handle HTTP requests and orchestrate business logic.
  - **Request and Response DTOs:**  
    - Dedicated DTO subpackages parse incoming requests (e.g., user login, article creation) and format outgoing responses (e.g., ProfileResponse, ArticleResponse) for client consumption.
  - **Configuration:**  
    - Holds the security and web-related configuration, including custom JWT authentication converters, exception handling, and security filter setup.
  - **Testing:**  
    - Unit tests focused on API response integrity and configuration correctness ensure proper translation between domain models and JSON responses, as well as valid security configuration.
  
- ## Core Module
  - **Domain Models and Repositories:**  
    - Central business entities such as Article, User, Tag, and associative entities (e.g., ArticleTag, UserFollow) are defined here along with repository interfaces for data access.
  - **Service Layer:**  
    - Implements business logic around domain functionalities including article processing, tag management, user services, and social interactions.
  - **Test Fixtures:**  
    - Provides standardized data fixtures for reliable testing of domain models and service interactions.
  
- ## Persistence Module
  - **Configuration:**  
    - Contains data source and JPA auditing configurations, ensuring consistent persistence behavior.
  - **Repository Implementation:**  
    - Implements the persistence layer using JPA repository interfaces and adapters to handle queries and data storage effectively.

- ## Bootstrap Module

    - Contains the main class that initiates the Spring Boot application and ensures that the runtime context is correctly loaded.
  - **Startup Tests:**  
    - Validates the application startup and verifies that the Spring Boot context loads correctly.

# Data Model and Entity Relationships

The domain model design revolves around several key entities and their relationships:

- **Tag:**  
  - Categorizes articles. Related to articles via the many-to-many join entity ArticleTag.
  
- **User:**  
  - Represents an application user who can author articles, comment, and follow other users. Relationships include authored articles, written comments, and social (follow) relationships.
  
- **UserFollow:**  
  - A join entity capturing follow relationships between users, linking a follower to a followed user.
  
- **Article:**  
  - Central to the content management system, an article holds content, description, and metadata. It is authored by a User and associated with Tags, Comments, and Favorites.
  
- **ArticleTag:**  
  - A join table for the many-to-many relationship between Articles and Tags.
  
- **ArticleFavorite:**  
  - Maps favoriting actions of users on articles.
  
- **ArticleComment:**  
  - Stores comments made by users on articles, linking a comment to its author and the associated article.
  
- **Auxiliary DTOs and Wrappers:**
  - **ArticleFacets:** Handles article filtering and pagination.
  - **RealWorldAuthenticationToken:** Wraps JWT authentication and provides token-related helper methods.
  - **UserRegistry:** Captures user registration data.
  - **ArticleDetails:** Consolidates detailed views of an article along with favorite count and user-specific details.
  - **ArticleCommentResponse and UserResponse:** Standardized DTOs used to format output for client-side consumption.

# Component Interactions

- **API Layer to Core Services:**  
  - REST controllers receive HTTP requests, transform incoming DTOs into core domain model instances, and delegate business processing to service layer classes (e.g., ArticleService, UserService, TagService).
  
- **Core Services to Persistence:**  
  - After processing business logic, services interact with the persistence layer via repository interfaces and adapters to query or store domain entities.
  
- **Security Configuration:**  
  - Custom JWT converters and authentication tokens ensure proper security context is passed from the client to the backend, and these tokens are used both in API request filtering and in constructing response profiles.
  
- **Test Interactions:**  
  - Test fixtures support reproducible tests across domain models and service interactions ensuring that the API and persistence operations adhere to business rules.
  
- **Dependency Graph:**  
  - The provided dependency graph (in MermaidJS) illustrates the flow between configuration elements, controllers, DTOs, core models, and services, showcasing the layered interactions and how data transformation takes place between these layers.

---

# Technologies and Frameworks

- **Java and Spring Boot:**  
  - Core framework facilitating dependency injection, configuration management, and REST API creation.
  
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):**  
  - For object-relational mapping and data persistence, along with specifications for dynamic querying.
  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  
  - Implements security via token-based authentication for API access.
  
- **BCrypt:**  
  - Employed for secure password encoding.
  
- **MermaidJS:**  
  - Used (externally) for representing dependency graphs to illustrate component relationships.
  
- **Testing Frameworks:**  
  - Integrated unit tests across modules help ensure the application functions as expected. Specific tests include API response validation, service layer business rule confirmation, and Spring Boot context loading.

---

# Notable Patterns and Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - The project is organized into distinct modules (API, Core, Persistence, Bootstrap) that isolate responsibilities thereby enhancing maintainability and testability.
  
- **DTO Usage:**  
  - Decoupling internal domain models from external representations via request and response DTOs ensures the platform remains flexible to changes in internal logic without impacting external contracts.
  
- **JWT-based Security:**  
  - Custom authentication token wrappers and security configurations provide a modular approach to implementing secure endpoints.
  
- **Testing with Fixtures:**  
  - Real-world test fixtures streamline the testing process, ensuring consistent domain model behavior across unit and service tests.
  
- **Dynamic Querying with JPA Specifications:**  
  - Offers flexible filtering of articles based on criteria like tags, authors, and favorites, accommodating diverse client-side query needs.
  
- **Centralized Exception Handling:**  
  - Ensures a consistent error-response mechanism across the API, improving client-side error management.
